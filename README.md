Image to ASCII converter
========================
Used modules:
	PIL
	tkinter

	Converts the given image to ASCII format through a simple thresholding/unsharping algorithm
Usage:
```
	$ ASCIIart.py <FileName> [-d, -g , -n, -w]
	# -d option shows image conversion steps through image viewer
	# -g option signals that a gif has been passed to the program
	# -n option tells the program to print the image as it gets generated - will make it run slow
	# -w option prints the image to a window (allows it to be copied to clipboard)
```
